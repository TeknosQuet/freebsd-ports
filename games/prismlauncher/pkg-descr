Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that was forked from MultiMC.
It allows the creation, and management of multiple installations of the game,
or "instances" rather, each having their own separate mods, resource packs,
settings, and more. While originally being forked over packaging/redistribution
concerns, Prism Launcher brings new and exciting features developed by the
community for the community. Furthermore, Prism Launcher is still just as true
to its roots as ever in providing a project that vows to never bring hostility
to those looking to fork, redistribute, or repackage, so long as the terms of
our license are respected.
