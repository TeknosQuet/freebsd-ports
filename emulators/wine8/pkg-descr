Wine is a compatibility layer for running Microsoft Windows programs (that is,
Win32) under Unix and Unix-like operating systems such as FreeBSD, macOS, and
Linux. In specific, it translates NT syscalls into native Unix-like equivalents
on-the-fly. It's capable of running many Windows applications with no issues.

This port builds Wine 8.0.2 (stable release) and has fixes for it to function
correctly on FreeBSD; I used emulators/wine-devel as a sort of reference to
make modifications and create this port. This serves as an alternative to the
current emulators/wine, emulators/wine7, and emulators/wine-devel ports to
serve as a stable but more recent version of Wine.

Note: Although it is possible to make a build using the experimental WoW64
      implementation, it is currently broken.
